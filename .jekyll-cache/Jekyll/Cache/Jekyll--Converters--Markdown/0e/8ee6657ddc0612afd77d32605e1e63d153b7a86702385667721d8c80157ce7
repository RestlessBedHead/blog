I"Ù<p>I used to wake up everyday and wonder, what is the point of everything?  I asked this question with a philosophical wonder but also a weary and slightly defeated sentiment.  Around this time
I was frequently experimenting/using drugs, so my brain chemistry was certaintly a precursor for the nature of how I posed this question.  These days (sober) I ask myself the question much less often (thankfully), however, it does come up on days when I have alot of time to think.  Itâ€™s a big question and arguably a waste of time to ponder, but itâ€™s fun so here we go anyways.</p>

<p>I fully realize that we donâ€™t understand how the universe formed.  We know the Big Bang likely happened, however, we donâ€™t know exactly what events precluded it.  Here Iâ€™m not concerned with how the Big Bang happend or any technical details, but more WHY it happened.  What is the point of matter + energy leaving super concentrated forms and exanding out into increasingly higher higher.</p>
