I"E<p>I used to wake up everyday and wonder, what is the point of everything?  I asked this question with a philosophical wonder but also a weary and slightly defeated sentiment.  Around this time
I was frequently experimenting/using drugs, so my brain chemistry was certaintly a precursor for the nature of how I posed this question.  These days (sober) I ask myself the question much less often (thankfully), however, it does come up on days when I have alot of time to think.  It’s a big question and arguably a waste of time to ponder, but it’s fun so here we go anyways.</p>
