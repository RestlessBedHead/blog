I used to wake up everyday and wonder, what is the point of everything?  I asked this question with a philosophical wonder but also a weary and slightly defeated sentiment.  Around this time
I was frequently experimenting/using drugs, so my brain chemistry was certaintly a precursor for the nature of how I posed this question.  These days (sober) I ask myself the question much less often (thankfully), however, it does come up on days when I have alot of time to think.  It's a big question and arguably a waste of time to ponder, but it's fun so here we go anyways.

I fully realize that we don't understand how the universe formed.  We know the Big Bang likely happened, however, we don't know exactly what events precluded it.  Here I'm not concerned with how the Big Bang happend or any technical details, but more WHY it happened.  What is the point of matter + energy leaving super concentrated forms and expanding out into increasingly higher levels of entropy.
