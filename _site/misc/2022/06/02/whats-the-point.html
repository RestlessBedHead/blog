<p>I fully realize that we don’t understand how the universe formed.  We know the Big Bang likely happened, however, we don’t know exactly what events precluded it.  Here I’m not concerned with how the Big Bang happend or any technical details, but more WHY it happened.  What is the point of matter + energy leaving super concentrated forms and exanding out into increasingly higher higher.</p>
